# YTQuickStamper
A tool for creating timestamps on YouTube videos quickly and easily.

Based on [Krazete's ytlivestamper bookmarklet](https://github.com/Krazete/bookmarklets/blob/master/ytlivestamper.js). Adapted for use as an extension with additional features!

 > [!NOTE]  
> This was modified largely for my personal use, but I figured it would be useful enough for someone out there

- Create timestamps with descriptions in a single click on both ongoing live streams and regular videos
- Individually delete and adjust timing of each timestamp
- Export timestamps to text, YouTube links, or Markdown
- Adjustable offset to add context to timestamps
